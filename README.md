ðŸŒŸ Core Features of a Crowdfunding Campaign
1. Campaign Initialization
Owner/creator sets up the campaign.

Defines the funding goal (in ETH or tokens).

Sets a deadline (timestamp or duration).

May include a description, title, or other metadata (off-chain or on-chain).

2. Contributions
Anyone can contribute funds (ETH or tokens).

Contributions are tracked per user.

Typically supports multiple contributions from the same address.

May include minimum or maximum contribution limits.

3. Goal Tracking
Real-time tracking of total amount raised.

Automatically marks the goal as reached once the target is hit.

Allows visibility into how much is still needed.

4. Deadline Handling
Accepts contributions only before the deadline.

After the deadline:

If the goal is reached â†’ Owner can withdraw.

If the goal is not reached â†’ Contributors can request refunds.

5. Fund Withdrawal
Only the campaign owner can withdraw the funds.

Withdrawals are allowed only if the goal is met and after the deadline.

Ensures one-time withdrawal (prevents double spending).

6. Refund Mechanism
Contributors can claim a refund if the campaign fails (goal not reached).

Refunds are only allowed after the deadline and if the goal is unmet.

Automatically resets their contribution amount after refund.

7. Events for Transparency
